Object oriented programming

1. Classes & Objects
class:
class is a template. It's like a structure. e.g, house map. classes are blueprint of an object.

Objects: 

a) property (variable) anything that has value is called property
b) behavior (functions)


2. Constructor
A constructor allows you to initialize an object's properties upon creation of the object.

If you create a __construct() function, PHP will automatically call this function when you create an object from a class.

Notice that the construct function starts with two underscores (__)!

3. Inheritance
Inheritance in OOP = When a class derives from another class.

The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class. In addition, it can have its own properties and methods.

An inherited class is defined by using the extends keyword.

4. Access Modifiers
Properties and methods can have access modifiers which control where they can be accessed.

There are three access modifiers:

public - the property or method can be accessed from everywhere. This is default
protected - the property or method can be accessed within the class and by classes derived from that class
private - the property or method can ONLY be accessed within the class
